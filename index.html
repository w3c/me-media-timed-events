        This document collects use cases and requirements for improved support
        for timed events related to audio or video media on the web, where
        synchronization to a playing audio or video media stream is needed,
        and makes recommendations for new or changed web APIs to realize these
        requirements. The goal is to extend the existing support in HTML for
        text track cue events to add support for dynamic content replacement
        cues and generic metadata events that drive synchronized interactive
        media experiences, and improve the timing accuracy of rendering of web
        content intended to be synchronized with audio or video media playback.

        The Media &amp; Entertainment Interest Group may update these
        use cases and requirements over time. Development of new web APIs based
        on the requirements described here, for example, <code>DataCue</code>,
        will proceed in the <a href="https://wicg.io/">Web Platform
        Incubator Community Group (WICG)</a>, with the goal of eventual
        standardization within a W3C Working Group. Contributors to this
        document are encouraged to participate in the WICG. Where the
        requirements described here affect the HTML specification, contributors
        will follow up with <a href="https://whatwg.org/">WHATWG</a>. The Interest
        Group will continue to track these developments and provide input and
        review feedback on how any proposed API meets these requirements.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        There is a need in the media industry for an API to support metadata
        events synchronized to audio or video media, specifically for both
        <a>out-of-band</a> event streams and <a>in-band</a> discrete events
        (for example, MPD and <code>emsg</code> events in MPEG-DASH).
        These <a>media timed events</a> can be used to support use cases
        such as dynamic content replacement, ad insertion, or presentation of
        supplemental content alongside the audio or video, or more generally,
        making changes to a web page, or executing application code triggered
        from JavaScript events, at specific points on the <a>media timeline</a>
        of an audio or video media stream.

      <h2>Use cases</h2>
      <p>
        <a>Media timed events</a> carry metadata that is related to points in time,
        or regions of time on the <a>media timeline</a>, which can be used to
        trigger retrieval and/or rendering of web resources synchronized with
        media playback. Such resources can be used to enhance user experience
        in the context of media that is being rendered. Some examples include
        display of social media feeds corresponding to a live video stream such
        as a sporting event, banner advertisements for sponsored content,
        accessibility-related assets such as large print rendering of
        captions, and display of track titles or images alongside an audio
        stream.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following sections describe a few use cases in more detail.
      </p>
      <section id="dynamic-content-insertion">
        <h3>Dynamic content insertion</h3>
        <p>
          A media content provider wants to allow insertion of content,
          such as personalised video, local news, or advertisements,
          into a video media stream that contains the main program content.
          To achieve this, <a>media timed events</a> can be used to describe the points
          on the <a>media timeline</a>, known as splice points, where switching
          playback to inserted content is possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Society for Cable and Televison Engineers (SCTE) specification
          "Digital Program Insertion Cueing for Cable" [[SCTE35]] defines a data
          cue format for describing such insertion points. Use of these cues in
          MPEG-DASH and HLS streams is described in [[SCTE35]], sections 12.1
          and 12.2.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Audio stream with titles and images</h3>
        <p>
          A media content provider wants to provide visual information alongside
          an audio stream, such as an image of the artist and title of the
          current playing track, to give users live information about the
          content they are listening to.
        </p>
        <p>
          HLS timed metadata [[HLS-TIMED-METADATA]] uses
          <a>in-band</a> ID3 metadata to carry the artist and title information,
          and image content. RadioVIS in DVB ([[DVB-DASH]], section 9.1.7)
          defines <a>in-band</a> event messages that contain image URLs and text
          messages to be displayed, with information about when the content
          should be displayed in relation to the <a>media timeline</a>.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Control messages for media streaming clients</h3>
        <p>
          A media streaming server uses <a>media timed events</a> to send control
          messages to media client library, such as <a href="https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js">dash.js</a>.
          Typically segmented streaming protocols such as HLS and MPEG-DASH make
          use of a manifest document that informs the client of the available
          encodings of a media stream, e.g., the Media Presentation Description
          (MPD) document in [[MPEGDASH]].
        </p>
        <p>
          Should any of the content in the manifest document need to change, the
          client should refresh it by requesting an updated copy from the
          server. Section 5.10.4 of [[MPEGDASH]] describes an MPEG-DASH specific
          event that is used to notify a client application. An <a>in-band</a>
          <code>emsg</code> event is used as an alternative to setting a cache
          duration in the response to the HTTP request for the manifest, so the
          client can refresh the MPD when it actually changes, as opposed to
          waiting for a cache duration expiry period to elapse. This also has
          the benefit of reducing the load on HTTP servers caused by frequent
          server requests.

        <h3>Subtitle and caption rendering synchronization</h3>
        <p>
          A subtitle or caption author wants ensure that subtitle changes are
          aligned as closely as possible to shot changes in the video.
          The BBC Subtitle Guidelines [[BBC-SUBTITLE]] describes authoring
          best practices. In particular, in section 6.1 authors are advised
          "it is likely to be less tiring for the viewer if shot changes
          and subtitle changes occur at the same time. Many subtitles therefore
          start on the first frame of the shot and end on the last frame."
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Synchronized map animations</h3>
        <p>
          A user records footage with metadata, including geolocation, on a
          mobile video device, e.g., drone or dashcam, to share on the web
          alongside a map, e.g., OpenStreetMap.
        </p>
        <p>
          [[WEBVMT]] is an open format for metadata cues, synchronized with a
          timed media file, that can be used to drive an online map rendered in
          a separate HTML element alongside the <a>media element</a> on the web page.
          The media playhead position controls presentation and animation of the
          map, e.g., pan and zoom, and allows annotations to be added and
          removed, e.g., markers, at specified times during media playback.
          Control can also be overridden by the user with the usual interactive
          features of the map at any time, e.g., zoom. Concrete examples are
          provided by the <a href="http://webvmt.org/demos">tech demos</a> at
          the WebVMT website.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Media analysis visualization</h3>
        <p>
          A video image analysis system processes a media stream to detect and
          recognize objects shown in the video. This system generates metadata
          describing the objects, including timestamps that describe the when
          the objects are visible, together with position information (e.g.,
          bounding boxes). A web application then uses this timed metadata to
          overlay labels and annotations on the video using HTML and CSS.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Presentation of auxiliary content in live media</h3>
        <p>
          During a live media presentation, dynamic and unpredictable events
          may occur which cause temporary suspension of the media presentation.
          During that suspension interval, auxiliary content such as the presentation
          of UI controls and media files, may be unavailable. Depending on the
          specific user engagement (or not) with the UI controls and the time
          at which any such engagement occurs, specific web resources may be
          rendered at defined times in a synchronized manner. For example,
          a multimedia A/V clip along with subtitles corresponding to an
          advertisement, and which were previously downloaded and cached
          by the UA, are played out.

        <h3>MPEG Common Media Application Format (CMAF)</h3>
        <p>
          MPEG Common Media Application Format (CMAF) [[MPEGCMAF]] is a media
          container format optimized for large scale delivery of a single
          encrypted, adaptable multimedia presentation to a wide range of
          devices and adaptive streaming methods, including HTTP Live Streaming
          [[RFC8216]] and MPEG-DASH [[MPEGDASH]]. It is based on the ISO BMFF
          [[ISOBMFF]] and supports the AVC, AAC, HEVC codecs, Common Encryption
          (CENC), and subtitles using IMSC1 and WebVTT. The goal is to reduce
          media storage and delivery costs by using a single common media format
          across different client devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          CMAF media may contain <a>in-band</a> events in the form of
          Event Message (<code>emsg</code>) boxes in ISO BMFF files.
          <code>emsg</code> is specified in [[MPEGDASH]], section 5.10.3.3,
          and described in more detail in the following section of this
          document.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>MPEG-DASH</h3>
        <p>
          MPEG-DASH is an adaptive bitrate streaming technique in which the
          audio and video media is partitioned into segments. The Media
          Presentation Description (MPD) is an XML document that contains
          metadata required by a DASH client to access the media segments and to
          provide the streaming service to the user. The media segments can use
          any codec, typically within a fragmented MP4 (ISO BMFF) container or
          MPEG-2 transport stream.
        </p>
        <p>
          In MPEG-DASH, <a>media timed events</a> may be delivered either
          <a>in-band</a> or <a>out-of-band</a>:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a>In-band</a> events are <code>emsg</code> boxes in ISO BMFF files.
            The presence of <code>emsg</code> events in the media container for
            given event schemes is signaled in the MPD document using an
            <code>EventStream</code> XML element ([[MPEGDASH]], section 5.10.2).
          </li>
          <li>
            <a>Out-of-band</a> events are represented by <code>Event</code>
            XML elements </code>contained within an <code>EventStream</code>
            element in the MPD.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          An <code>emsg</code> event contains the following information,
          as specified in [[MPEGDASH]], section 5.10.3.3:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>scheme_id_uri</code> &mdash; A URI that identifies
          the message scheme</li>
          <li><code>value</code> &mdash; The event value (string)</li>
          <li><code>timescale</code> &mdash; Timescale units, in ticks
          per second</li>
          <li><code>presentation_time_delta</code> &mdash; Presentation
          time delta (with respect to the media segment),
          in <code>timescale</code> units</li>
          <li><code>event_duration</code> &mdash; Event duration,
          in <code>timescale</code> units</li>
          <li><code>id</code> &mdash; Event message identifier</li>
          <li><code>message_data</code> &mdash; Message body (may be empty)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>HbbTV</h3>
        <p>
          HbbTV is an interactive TV application standard that supports both
          broadcast (DVB) media delivery, and internet streaming using
          MPEG-DASH. The HbbTV application environment is based on HTML and
          JavaScript. MPEG-DASH streaming is implemented nativey by the user
          agent, rather than through a JavaScript web application using Media
          Source Extensions.
        </p>
        <p>
          HbbTV includes support for <code>emsg</code> events ([[DVB-DASH]],
          section 9.1) and requires this be mapped to HTML5 <code>DataCue</code>

        <h3>DASH Industry Forum APIs for Interactivity</h3>
        <p>
          The DASH-IF InterOp Working Group has an ongoing work item,
          <em>DAInty</em>, "DASH APIs for Interactivity", which aims to
          specify a set of APIs between the DASH client/player and interactivity-capable
          applications, for both web and native applications [[DASHIFIOP]]. The origin of this
          work is a related
          <a href="http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/tsg_sa/TSG_SA/TSGS_77/Docs/SP-170796.zip">3GPP
          work item</a> on Service Interactivity [[3GPP-INTERACTIVITY]].
          The objective is to provide service enablers for user engagement with
          auxiliary content and UIs on mobile device during live or time-shifted
          viewing of streaming content delivered over 3GPP broadcast or unicast
          bearers, and the measurement and reporting of such interactive consumption.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two APIs are being developed that are relevant to the scope of the present
          document:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Application subscription/DASH client dispatch of DASH event stream
            messages containing interactivity information. Events can be delivered
            <a>in-band</a> (<code>emsg</code>) and/or as MPD events.
          </li>
          <li>
            Application subscription/DASH client dispatch of ISO BMFF Timed
            Metadata tracks providing similar functionality to DASH event streams.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Two modes for dispatching events
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/08/20-me-minutes.html#item05"></a>are
          defined</a>. In Mode 1 events are
          dispatched at the time the event arrives, and in Mode 2 events are
          dispatched at the given time on the <a>media timeline</a>. The
          "arrival" of events from the DASH client perspective may be either
          static or pre-provisioned, in the case MPD Events, or dynamic in the
          case of <a>in-band</a> events carried in the <code>emsg</code>. The
          application can register with the DASH client which Mode to use.

        <h3>SCTE-35</h3>
        <p>
          The Society for Cable and Televison Engineers (SCTE) has produced the
          SCTE-35 specification "Digital Program Insertion Cueing for Cable"
          [[SCTE35]], which defines a data cue format for describing
          insertion points, to support the
          <a href="#dynamic-content-insertion">dynamic content insertion</a> use
          case.
        </p>
        <p>
          [[SCTE214-1]] section 6.7 describes the carriage of SCTE-35 events
          in a MPEG-DASH MPD document, as <a>out-of-band</a> events.
          [[SCTE214-2]] section 9 and [[SCTE214-3]] section 7.3 describe
          the carriage of SCTE-35 events as <a>in-band</a> events in MPEG-DASH
          using MPEG2-TS and ISO BMFF respectively, using <code>emsg</code>.
        </p>
          [[SCTE35]] section 9.1 describes the requirements for content
          splicing: "In order to give advance warning of the impending splice
          (a pre-roll function), the splice_insert() command could be sent
          multiple times before the splice point. For example, the
          splice_insert() command could be sent at 8, 5, 4 and 2 seconds prior
          to the packet containing the related splice point. In order to meet
          other splicing deadlines in the system, any message received with less
          than 4 seconds of advance notice may not create the desired result."
        </p>
        <p>
          This places an implicit requirement on the user agent in handling of
          media-timed events related to insertion cues. The content originator
          may provide the cue in advance with as little as 2 seconds of the
          insertion time. Therefore the propagation of the event data associated
          with the insertion cue to the application by the user agent should be
          considerably less than 2 seconds.

        <p>
          The MPEG Working Draft on Carriage of Web Resources in ISO BMFF
          [[WEB-ISOBMFF]] is a draft document that specifies the use of the
          ISO BMFF container format for the storage and delivery of web
          content. The goal is to allow web resources (HTML, JavaScript, etc.)
          to be parsed from the storage and processed by a user agent at
          specific presentation times on the <a>media timeline</a>, and so be
          synchronized with other tracks within the container, such as audio,
          video, and subtitles.

        <p>
          [[WEBVTT]] is a W3C specification that provides a format for web video
          text tracks. A <a>VTTCue</a> is a text track cue, and may have
          attributes that affect rendering of the cue text on a web page.
          WebVTT metadata cues are text that is aligned to the
          <a>media timeline</a>. Web applications can use <a>VTTCue</a>
          to schedule <a>out-of-band</a> metadata events by serializing the
          event data to a string format (JSON, for example) when creating the
          cue, and deserializing the data when the cue is triggered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Web applications can also use <a>VTTCue</a> to trigger
          rendering of <a>out-of-band</a> delivered timed text cues, such as
          TTML or IMSC format captions.

          The <code>DataCue</code> API has been previously discussed as a means
          to deliver <a>in-band</a> event data to web applications, but this is
          not implemented in all of the main browser engines. It is

          in the 18 October 2018 HTML 5.3 draft [[HTML53-20181018]], but is
          <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#timed-text-tracks">not included</a>
          in [[HTML]]. See discussion <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/blink-dev/U06zrT2N-Xk">here</a>

          WebKit <a href="https://discourse.wicg.io/t/media-timed-events-api-for-mpeg-dash-mpd-and-emsg-events/3096/2">supports</a>
          a <code>DataCue</code> interface that extends HTML5 <code>DataCue</code>
          with two attributes to support non-text metadata, <code>type</code> and
          <code>value</code>.
        </p>
        <pre class="example">
          interface DataCue : TextTrackCue {

            attribute any value;
            readonly attribute DOMString type;
          };
        </pre>
        <p>
          <code>type</code> is a string identifying the type of metadata:

            <tr>

        <p>
          On resource constrained devices such as smart TVs and streaming sticks,
          parsing media segments to extract event information leads to a significant
          performance penalty, which can have an impact on UI rendering updates if
          this is done on the UI thread. There can also be an impact on the battery
          life of mobile devices. Given that the media segments will be parsed anyway
          by the user agent, parsing in JavaScript is an expensive overhead that
          could be avoided.
        </p>
        <p>
          Avoiding parsing in JavaScript is also important for low latency
          video streaming applications, where minimizing the time taken to pass
          media content through to the media element's playback buffer is
          essential.
        </p>

          [[HBBTV]] section 9.3.2 describes a mapping between the <code>emsg</code>
          fields described <a href="#mpeg-dash">above</a>
          and the <a>TextTrack</a>
          and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/WD-html53-20180426/semantics-embedded-content.html#datacue"><code>DataCue</code></a>
          APIs. A <a>TextTrack</a> instance is created for each event
          stream signalled in the MPD document (as identified by the
          <code>schemeIdUri</code> and <code>value</code>), and the

          <a>TextTrack</a> attribute contains the <code>scheme_id_uri</code>
          and <code>value</code> values. Because HbbTV devices include a native
          DASH client, parsing of the MPD document and creation of the
          <a>TextTrack</a>s is done by the user agent, rather than by
          application JavaScript code.

        <h3>Synchronized rendering of web resources</h3>
        <p>
          In browsers, non media web rendering is handled through repaint
          operations at a rate that generally matches the display refresh rate
          (e.g., 60 times per second), following the user's wall clock. A web
          application can schedule actions and render web content at specific
          points on the user's wall clock, notably through
          <a>Performance.now()</a>, <a>setTimeout()</a>, <a>setInterval()</a>,
          and <a>requestAnimationFrame()</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In most cases, media rendering follows a different path, be it because
          it gets handled by a dedicated background process or by dedicated
          hardware circuitry. As a result, progress along the <a>media
          timeline</a> may follow a
          <a data-cite="HTML/media.html#offsets-into-the-media-resource:media-timeline-8">
          clock</a> different from the user's wall clock. [[HTML]] recommends
          that the media clock approximate the user's wall clock but does not
          require it to match the user's wall clock.
        </p>
        <p>
          To synchronize rendering of web content to a video with frame
          accuracy, a web application needs:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A way to track progress along the <a>media timeline</a> with
            <em>sufficient precision</em>. The actual precision required depends
            on the use case. Subtitles for video are typically authored against
            video at the nominal video frame rate, e.g., 25 frames per second,
            which corresponds to 40 milliseconds per frame, even when the actual
            video frame rate gets adjusted dynamically ([[EBU-TT-D]], Annex E).
            This suggests a 20 milliseconds precision, or half of the duration
            of a typical video frame, to render subtitles with frame accuracy.
          </li>
          <li>
            In cases where synchronization needs to occur at frame boundaries, a
            way to tie the rendering of non media content, typically done at the
            display refresh rate, with the rendering of a video frame. This need
            does not replace the former one: a web application that needs to
            render web content at media frame boundaries may also need to
            perform actions at specific points on the <a>media timeline</a>
            regardless of when the next frame gets rendered.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The following sub-sections discusses mechanisms currently available to
          web applications to track progress on the <a>media timeline</a> and
          render content at frame boundaries.

          <h4>Using cues to track progress on the media timeline</h4>
          <p>
            Cues (e.g., <a>TextTrackCue</a>, or <a>VTTCue</a>) are
            units of time-sensitive data on a <a>media timeline</a> [[HTML]]. The
            <a>time marches on</a> steps in [[HTML]] control the firing of cue
            events during media playback. <a>Time marches on</a> requires a
            <a>timeupdate</a> event to be fired at the <a>media element</a>
            between 15 and 250 milliseconds since the last such event, and this
            requirement therefore specifies the rate at which <a>time marches
            on</a> is executed during playback. In practice it
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/12/17-me-minutes.html#item06">has
            been found</a> that the timing varies between browser
            implementations.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are two methods a web application can use to handle cues:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Add an <a>oncuechange</a> handler function to the <a>TextTrack</a>
              and inspect the track's <a>activeCues</a> list. Because
              <a>activeCues</a> contains the list of cues that are active at the
              time that <a>time marches on</a> is run, it is possible for cues
              to be missed by a web application using this method, where cues
              appear on the <a>media timeline</a> between successive executions
              of <a>time marches on</a> during media playback. This may occur
              if the cues have short duration, or by a long-running event
              handler function.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add <a>onenter</a> and <a>onexit</a> handler functions
              to each cue. The <a>time marches on</a> steps guarantee that
              <a>enter</a> and <a>exit</a> events will be fired for all cues,
              including those that appear on the <a>media timeline</a> between
              successive executions of <a>time marches on</a> during media
              playback. The timing accuracy of these events varies between
              browser implementations, as the firing of the events is controlled
              by the rate of execution of <a>time marches on</a>.
            </li>
          </ul>

            An issue with handling of text track and data cue events in HbbTV
            <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-inbandtracks/2013Dec/0004.html">was
            reported</a> in 2013. HbbTV requires the user agent to implement an
            MPEG-DASH client, and so applications must use the first of the
            above methods for cue handling, which means that applications can
            miss cues as described above. A similar issue has been
            <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/3137">filed</a>
            against the HTML specification.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Using <code>timeupdate</code> events from the media element</h4>
          <p>
            Another approach to synchronizing rendering of web content to media
            playback is to use the <a>timeupdate</a> event, and for the
            web application to manage the <a>media timed events</a> to be
            triggered, rather than use the text track cue APIs in [[HTML]].
            This approach has the same synchronization
            limitations as described above due to the 250 millisecond update
            rate specified in <a>time marches on</a>, and so is
            <a data-cite="HTML/media.html#best-practices-for-metadata-text-tracks:event-media-timeupdate">explicitly
            discouraged</a> in [[HTML]]. In addition, the timing variability of
            <a>timeupdate</a> events between browser engines makes them
            unreliable for the purpose of synchronized rendering of web content.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Polling the current position on the media timeline</h4>
          <p>
            Synchronization accuracy can be improved by polling the media
            element's <a>currentTime</a> property from a <a>setInterval()</a>
            callback, or by using <a>requestAnimationFrame()</a> for greater
            accuracy. This technique can be useful in where content should be
            animated smoothly in synchronicity with the media, for example,
            rendering a playhead position marker in an audio waveform
            visualization, or displaying web content at specific points on the
            <a>media timeline</a>. However, the use of <a>setInterval()</a> or
            <a>requestAnimationFrame()</a> for media synchronized rendering
            is CPU intensive.

          <h4>Detecting when the next media frame will be rendered</h4>
          <p>
            [[HTML]] does not expose any precise mechanism to assess the time,
            from a user's wall clock perspective, at which a particular media
            frame is going to be rendered. A web application may only infer this
            information by looking at the <a>media element</a>'s
            <a>currentTime</a> property to infer the frame being rendered
            and the time at which the user will see the next frame. This has
            several limitations:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a>currentTime</a> is represented as a <code>double</code>
              value, which does not allow to identify individual frames due to
              rounding errors. This is a
              <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/609">known
              issue</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <a>currentTime</a> is updated at a user-agent defined rate
              (typically the rate at which <a>time marches on</a> runs), and is
              kept stable while scripts are running. When a web application
              reads <a>currentTime</a>, it cannot tell when this property
              was last updated, and thus cannot reliably assess whether this
              property still represents the frame currently being rendered.

      <h2>Recommendations</h2>
      <p>
        This section describes recommendations from the Media &amp; Entertainment
        Interest Group for the development of a generic <a>media timed event</a> API,
        and associated synchronization considerations.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Subscribing to event streams</h3>
        <p>
          The API should allow web applications to subscribe to receive specific
          event streams by event type. For example, to support MPEG-DASH
          <code>emsg</code> and MPD events, the API should allow subscription by
          <code>id</code> and (optional) <code>value</code>. This is to make
          receiving events opt-in from the application point of view. The user
          agent should deliver only those events to a web application for which
          the application has subscribed. The API should also allow web
          applications to unsubscribe from specific event streams by event type.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Out-of-band events</h3>
        <p>
          To be able to handle out of band events, including MPEG-DASH MPD
          events, the API should allow web applications to create events to be
          added to the <a>media timeline</a>, to be triggered by the user agent.
          The API should allow the web application to provide all necessary
          parameters to define the event, including start and end times, event
          type, and data payload. The payload should be any data type (e.g., the
          set of types supported by the WebKit <code>DataCue</code>). For
          MPEG-DASH MPD events, the event type is defined by the <code>id</code>
          and (optional) <code>value</code> fields.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Event triggering</h3>
        <p>
          For those events that the application has subscribed to receive,
          the API should:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Generate a JavaScript event when an <a>in-band</a> <a>media timed event</a>
            is parsed from the media container or media stream (DAInty Mode 1).
          </li>
          <li>
            Generate JavaScript events when the current media playback
            position reaches the start time and the end time of a media timed
            event during playback (DAInty Mode 2). This applies equally to
            <a>in-band</a> events that the user agent has extracted from the
            media container, and <a>out-of-band</a> events added by the web
            application.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The API should provide guarantees that no events can be missed during
          linear playback of the media.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>In-band event processing</h3>
        <p>
          We recommend updating [[INBANDTRACKS]] to describe handling of
          <a>in-band</a> <a>media timed events</a> supported on the web platform,
          following a registry approach with one specification per media format
          that describes the event details for that format.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>MPEG-DASH events</h3>
        <p>
          We recommend that browser engines support MPEG-DASH <code>emsg</code>
          <a>in-band</a> events and MPD <a>out-of-band</a> events, as part of
          their support for the MPEG Common Media Application Format (CMAF)
          [[MPEGCMAF]].
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Synchronization</h3>
        <p>
          In order to achieve greater synchronization accuracy between media
          playback and web content rendered by an application, the <a>time
          marches on</a> steps in [[HTML]] should be modified to allow delivery
          of <a>media timed event</a> start time and end time notifications within 20
          milliseconds of their positions on the <a>media timeline</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, to allow such synchronization to happen at frame
          boundaries, we recommend introducing a mechanism that would allow a
          web application to accurately predict, using the user's wall clock,
          when the next frame will be rendered (e.g., as done in the
          <a href="https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#dom-audiocontext-getoutputtimestamp">Web
          Audio API</a>).
