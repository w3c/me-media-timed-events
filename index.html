        This document collects use cases and requirements for improved support
        for timed events related to audio or video media on the Web, such as
        subtitles, captions, or other web content, where synchronization to a
        playing audio or video media stream is needed, and makes recommendations
        for new or changed Web APIs to realize these requirements.

          Add use case descriptions for DASH and emsg events here.
          Describe a few motivating application scenarios.
        </p>
        <p>
          In MPEG DASH, events may be conveyed either via an EventStream fragment
          in the MPD (Media Presentation Description) document, or as 'in-band'
          events, i.e., <code>emsg</code> boxes in ISO BMFF files. In addition,
          the MPD document may advertise the presence of <code>emsg</code>
          events in the ISO BMFF content for given schemas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use cases for <code>emsg</code> boxes include:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Displaying of images alongside an audio stream. For example, in
              RadioVIS in DVB, the <code>emsg</code> event contains an image URL,
              which the UA requests. In this use case, synchronization of the
              image rendering to within a second or so is acceptable
              ([[DVB-DASH]], section 9.1.7).
            </li>
            <li>
              Notifying the DASH player Web application that it should refresh
              the MPD document ([[MPEGDASH]], section 5.10.4).
            </li>

          [[WEB-ISOBMFF]] specifies the use of ISO BMFF tools for the storage
          and delivery of web data. The specified storage is designed to enable
          enriching audio/video content, as well as audio-only content, with
          synchronized, animated, interactive web data, including overlays.

        <h3>HbbTV</h3>
        <p>
          HbbTV includes support for <code>emsg</code> events ([[DVB-DASH]],
          section 9.1) and requires this be mapped to <code>DataCue</code>
          ([[HBBTV]], section 9.3.2). The HbbTV device test suite includes
          test pages and streams for this ([[HBBTV-TESTS]]). This feature is
          included in user agents shipping in connected TVs across Europe from
          2017. HbbTV has a <a href="https://github.com/HbbTV-Association/ReferenceApplication">reference app</a>
          and content for DASH+DRM which includes <code>emsg</code> support.
          As well as HbbTV devices, this reference app and content have been
          tested on Microsoft Edge with MSE and EME although <code>emsg</code>
          support does not work there.

        <h3>BBC Subtitle Guidelines</h3>
        <p>
          The BBC Subtitle Guidelines ([[BBC-SUBTITLES]]) describe best practice
          for authoring subtitles or captions. In particular, the guidelines state:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <b>5.2 Match subtitle to pace of speaking</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            The subtitles should match the pace of speaking as closely
            as possible. Ideally, when the speaker is in shot, your subtitles
            should not anticipate speech by more than 1.5 seconds or hang up on
            the screen for more than 1.5 seconds after speech has stopped.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>6.1 Match subtitles to shot</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            It is likely to be less tiring for the viewer if shot changes and
            subtitle changes occur at the same time. Many subtitles therefore
            start on the first frame of the shot and end on the last frame.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>6.2 Maintain a minimum gap when mismatched</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have to let a subtitle hang over a shot change, do not remove
            it too soon after the cut. The duration of the overhang will depend
            on the content.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>6.3 Avoid straddling shot changes</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Avoid creating subtitles that straddle a shot change (i.e., a subtitle
            that starts in the middle of shot one and ends in the middle of shot
            two). To do this, you may need to split a sentence at an appropriate
            point, or delay the start of a new sentence to coincide with the shot
            change.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          To meet these requirements, the playback system must honour the provided
          timings. Subtitles for video are typically authored against video at a
          nominal frame rate, e.g., 25 frames per second (which corresponds to
          40 milliseconds per frame). The actual video frame rate may be adjusted
          dynamically according to the video encoding, but the subtitle timing
          must remain the same ([[EBU-TT-D]], Annex E).

          <h4>DASH and ISO BMFF emsg events</h4>
          <p>
            An <code>emsg</code> event contains the following information,
            as specified in [[MPEGDASH]], section 5.10.3.3:
            <ul>
              <li><code>scheme_id_uri</code> &mdash; A URI that identifies
              the message scheme</li>
              <li><code>value</code> &mdash; The event value (string)</li>
              <li><code>timescale</code> &mdash; Timescale units, in ticks
              per second</li>
              <li><code>presentation_time_delta</code> &mdash; Presentation
              time delta (with respect to the media segment),
              in <code>timescale</code> units</li>
              <li><code>event_duration</code> &mdash; Event duration,
              in <code>timescale</code> units</li>
              <li><code>id</code> &mdash; Event message identifier</li>
              <li><code>message_data</code> &mdash; Message body (may be empty)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            The presence of <code>emsg</code> events in the media stream is signalled
            in the DASH manifest document (MPD), using an <code>EventStream</code> XML
            element ([[MPEGDASH]], section 5.10.2).
          </p>
          <p>
            The <code>DataCue</code> API has been previously discussed as a means to
            deliver in-band event data to Web applications, but this is not implemented
            in mainstream browser engines. It is <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/WD-html53-20180426/semantics-embedded-content.html#text-tracks-exposing-inband-metadata">included</a>
            in the 26 April 2018 HTML 5.3 draft [[HTML53-20180426]], but is
            <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#timed-text-tracks">not included</a>
            in [[HTML]]. See discussion <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/blink-dev/U06zrT2N-Xk">here</a>
            and notes on implementation status <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2016Apr/0005.html">here</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Neither [[MSE-BYTE-STREAM-FORMAT-ISOBMFF]] nor [[INBANDTRACKS]] describe
            handling of <code>emsg</code> boxes.
          </p>
          <p>
            [[HBBTV]] section 9.3.2 describes a mapping between the <code>emsg</code>
            fields described <a href="#dash-and-iso-bmff-emsg-events">above</a>
            and the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#texttrack"><code>TextTrack</code></a>
            and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/WD-html53-20180426/semantics-embedded-content.html#datacue"><code>DataCue</code></a>
            APIs. A <code>TextTrack</code> instance is created for each event
            stream signalled in the MPD document (as identified by the
            <code>schemeIdUri</code> and <code>value</code>), and the
            <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#dom-texttrack-inbandmetadatatrackdispatchtype"><code>inBandMetadataTrackDispatchType</code></a>
            <code>TextTrack</code> attribute contains the <code>scheme_id_uri</code>
            and <code>value </code> values. Because HbbTV devices include a native
            DASH client, parsing of the MPD document and creation of the
            <code>TextTrack</code>s is done by the UA.
          </p>
          <p class="ednote">
            To support DASH clients implemented in Web applications, there is
            therefore either a need for an API that allows applications to tell
            the UA which schemes it wants to receive, or the UA should simply
            expose all event streams to applications. Which of these is preferred?

            The timing guarantees provided in HTML5 regarding the triggering of
            <code>TextTrackCue</code> events may be not be enough to avoid
